# My travels

## This project is for testing Maps and geolocation.
My travels allows you to mark a specific location on the map, which you have already visited, 
and that location will be saved within the app.

To test things like setting up the map, moving the camera, adding markers, drawing polygons, 
retrieving the userâ€™s location and use geocode.
